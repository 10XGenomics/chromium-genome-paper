Supplementary Table Mendel. Overlapping and non-overlapping deletions >30kb with the svclassify set and the genotypes observed for NA12878 and her parents, whether phased or unphased. As Long Ranger does not output gVCF, symbol '-' is present if no call was made in that loci instead of genotyping it. To classify a SV, breakpoint co-location was also taken into account. False positives were classified as "likely-FP" because we could not discard a de-novo mutation. The description field contains explanatory notes.
